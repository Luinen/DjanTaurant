## Features

I explain the website features below.

### **Existing features**

  - The tutorial understands the game well for the users.
  - If the users knows the rules, they can skip this part by answering no.

- **Placing the ships**
  - After the grid selection, the users can decide where they want to place their ships.
  - The users don't see the the computer choices.
  - The AI randomly generates ships on the board.

- **Target system**
  - Everything is ready to play. The users start and then select the first target and after that the AI does the same.

## Bugs
- Solved Bugs
  - The AI chose the same location and started the game with only 3 or 4 ships.
  - It was possible if the user fired the same spot in the previous rounds.
  - The user was able to use numbers in the tutorial and caused an error. 
  - Fixed an index error, when the users want to put a ship, but it is out of the board range. 
- Unsolved Bugs
  - Unfortunately, I used Heroku and deployed my project, but I couldn't type anything on that site after that. I tried incognito mode, firefox and chrome, but nothing changed. It freezes all the time. I spent 2,5 hours with tutor assistance, they tried many things, but they didn't find the solution.  I also want to thank you from here. It works on other computers.
  - If the users enter nothing when they want to shoot, an error message pop up.
